# Personal-Webpage
Personal Webpage
- Used HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript to develop a personal website to showcase relevant information to recruits
- Used the Netlify forms feature to collect information from my contact page and get it delivered to my email
- Connected the site to Google analytics and enabled multi-campaign tracking
- Deployed the site to Netlify from my GitHub repository
