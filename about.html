                <h1>Who is Overpower Gore?</h1>
                <p><strong><em> “Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,just remember that not all the people in this world have had the advantages that you've had.” - Great Gatsby</em></strong></p>
                <p>My legal name is Overpower Gore; however, most people call me OPG. I was born and raised in Zimbabwe. I moved out of the country at the age of 18 to attend the United World College of Southern Africa (Waterford Kamhlaba) in Eswatini. I spent 2 years at Waterford Kamhlaba studying for the International Baccalaureate diploma and graduated in November 2018. </p>

                <p>Currently, I am a senior at Earlham College where I am majoring in Data Science and Global Management (with a focus on Management Information Technology). My area of interest lies at the intersection between technology and business.</p>
                    
                <p>I am passionate about changing our community using software and technology. In 5 years I see myself as either working as an analyst or software engineer. As a data practitioner, by providing insights that inform business decisions and using data in my community to inform decisions in my daily life. I believe “stories are just data with a soul”. Using the notion that “data speak”, my desire is to transform life’s.  </p>
